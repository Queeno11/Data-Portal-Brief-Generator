**Human capital – knowledge, skills, and good health – empowers people to achieve their potential and drives economic growth.** This brief tracks progress by Côte d’Ivoire in building and using human capital. This page presents the Human Capital Index (HCI), its components parts, and relevant benchmarks. The HCI quantifies how underinvestment in education and health for today’s children reduces future incomes. Data are the most recently available as of 2020. The back page presents a set of Human Capital Complementary Indicators (HCCI) that shows progress at each stage of the lifecycle.

### \boldblue{T\small{HE HUMAN CAPITAL INDEX}}###
\vspace{-2mm}

A child born in Côte d’Ivoire will be **38%** as productive when she grows up as she could be if she enjoyed complete education and full health. 

This is lower than the average for the Sub-Saharan Africa region (40%) and Lower Middle Income countries (48%).

### \boldblue{T\small{HE HUMAN CAPITAL INDEX COMPONENTS}}###
\vspace{-2mm}

* **Probability of Survival to Age 5.** Of every 100 children born in Côte d’Ivoire, **92** survive to age 5.

* **Expected Years of School.** In Côte d’Ivoire, a child who starts school at age 4 can expect to complete **8.1** years of school by her 18th birthday.

* **Learning-Adjusted Years of School.** Factoring in what children actually learn, expected years of school is **4.8** years.

* **Average Harmonized Test Scores.** Students in Côte d’Ivoire score **373** on a scale where 625 represents advanced attainment and 300 represents minimum attainment.

* **Adult Survival Rate.** Across Côte d’Ivoire, **66%** of 15-year-olds survive until age 60.

* **Fraction of Children Under 5 Not Stunted.** Approximately **78** out of 100 children are not stunted. This means that **22** out of 100 children are at risk of cognitive and physical limitations that can last a lifetime.

\vspace{-6mm}
### \boldblue{U\small{TILIZATION-ADJUSTED HUMAN CAPITAL INDEX}}###
\vspace{-2mm}

The Utilization-adjusted Human Capital Index (U-HCI) scales down the HCI by taking into account how many adults are not employed. The U-HCI for Côte d’Ivoire is **0.21**. Thus, children born today will be 21% as productive in adulthood as they could have been if they had access to full health and education, and they became fully employed adults. The U-HCI for girls is even lower at 0.17.
